# Team 8 - Project Proposal

Our project is build an algo trading machine which rely on 3 different indicators: Sentiment Analysis, Technical Analysis, and Candlestick Pattern Recognition.
The three indicators will be feed through Recurrent Neuron Network and train with data from Alpaca-API, TwitterText-API to learn to predict the next trading period whether we should buy or sale the stock.
